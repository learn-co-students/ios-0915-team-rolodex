#CURB ALERT 1.0
Find local goods in your hood. Curb Alert is all about fostering a community of giving. 
Donate your items to those in need instead of tossing them out. It's as easy as taking a picture and then setting your items on the curb.

##Use Guide
Find your items by browsing donations in your community. Once you find something you like, simply claim it to let others know you're interested. Items are first come first served so act quick! If you see something nearby you're not interested in, feel free to verify it so others will know it's available. See something questionable or not there? Flag it to alert us and your fellow users.
