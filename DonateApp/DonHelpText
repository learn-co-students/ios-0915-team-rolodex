Curb Alert

App Description
Curb Alert is an app designed to connect you with free goods readily available near you!
We want to foster a community of sharing and giving.  If you’re thinking of getting rid of something in your home consider instead posting a Curb Alert for it and setting it outside!  Help it find a new home where someone else can benefit from it.

Viewing Items
We’ve made it easy to sort through the types of items that interest you.  Click on a category filter to trim down the list of available items.  You can even view items on a map to see at a glance what’s nearby.

Community Guidelines
This app was designed for local communities so we rely on users like you to help us keep item information up to date. There are three ways to interact:
Claim - Indicate you’re going to pick up an item
Verify - Verify that an item nearby is actually there
Flag - Flag an item that doesn’t exist

Tips
Keep in mind you can only interact with an item when you’re nearby. But you can always view any item no matter where you are!
Items automatically expire after a couple of days with no activity

Listing Items
Click the List Item button in the menu to list your items! It’s as easy as taking a picture, entering in some information about the item, and then putting the item outside for other users to discover.
